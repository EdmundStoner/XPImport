# XP-Import
## Import X-plane object files into Blender2.8+


### Another work in progress


These files are a mod of David Prue's original XP-Import for Blender 2.8

The original files could not import sucsessfully into any Blender over 2.79
So I got to learn how Python3 and Blender cooperated together. They do pretty good.

I have loaded a few different simple X-Plane obj files into Blender 2.8-3.01 with this, but, I really don't know how to create aircraft, or much of anything else, very well in Blender. So I only repaired the Blender 2.8+ errors that were generated by the original, but not much of anything else.

This will not recreate animations, manipulator assignments or datarefs it is just to import the objects and apply their textures.

The zip file can be directly imported into Blender thru the preferences menu
