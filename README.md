###Import X-plane object into blender

These files are a mod od David Prue's original XP-Import for Blender 2.8

I could not get it to import sucsessfully into any Blender over 2.79
So I got to learn how Python3 and Blender cooperated together.

I have loaded a few different simple XPlane obj files into it, but, I really don't know how to create aircraft, or much of anything else, very well in Blender.
