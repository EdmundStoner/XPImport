# XP-Import
## Import X-plane object files into Blender2.8+


### Another work in progress


These files are a mod of David Prue's original XP-Import for Blender 2.8

The original files could not import sucsessfully into any Blender over 2.79
So I got to learn how Python3 and Blender cooperated together. They do pretty good.

I have loaded a few different simple XPlane obj files into Blender 2.8-3.3 with this, but, I really don't know how to create aircraft, or much of anything else, very well in Blender. So I only repaired the Blender 2.8+ errors that were generated by the original, but not much of anything else.
